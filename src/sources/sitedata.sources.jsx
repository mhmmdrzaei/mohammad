Here is where I attempt to neatly package all my interests together:</p><p>As a developer, I create custom built  accessible and responsive sites for my clients using the latest libraries, tools, and technologies. I aim to bridge the gap between the technology and the client needs regarding their brand and audience in the best light.  </p><p>I’m comfortable writing code using different languages + frameworks. This includes  <span>React</span>, <span>React Redux</span>, <span>GraphQL</span> and <span>Gatsby</span>. I  work with <span>CMS</span> clients and databases regularly to set up  <span>headless sites</span>. I’ve worked extensively with <span>Wordpress</span>, building <span>custom themes</span>, <span>custom post types</span>, and <span>custom widgets</span>  for clients. </p><p>I love problem solving using creative approaches, taking what I’ve learned as an arts and design enthusiast and applying it to every project.  </p><p>Let’s work together!</p>',
